# GoogleCloud_InventoryManagement_ML_Forecasting

Abstract: The project introduces a comprehensive solution for enhancing inventory management in the e-commerce domain. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Google Cloud Platform, our system integrates Big Data and Machine Learning to optimize inventory levels. The core of our analytics pipeline resides in Google BigQuery, where data summarization and analysis take place, providing dynamic insights into inventory availability and accurate demand forecasting. The culmination of our efforts is a user-friendly dashboard developed on Google's Looker Studio. This platform empowers end-users and clients to intuitively visualize product inventory counts and forecasts, facilitating informed decision-making and efficient inventory control.

# Dataset 

The [eCommerce dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce?project=galvanic-portal-404814) contains information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events and digital marketing campaigns. The contents of this dataset are synthetic, and are provided to industry practitioners for the purpose of product discovery, testing, and evaluation.

# Improve inventory management with sales forecasting deployed by BigQuery ML and AI Platform Training & Prediction

In the e-commerce sector, effectively managing inventory is crucial: you need to maintain the right balance, ensuring you have enough stock without overstocking. For large e-commerce companies, this involves managing inventory levels for a vast array of products.

To guide inventory decisions, historical sales data is invaluable. By analyzing past customer purchase patterns, you can predict future buying trends, helping to determine optimal inventory levels. Time series forecasting is an essential tool in this process.

For data science teams supporting e-commerce inventory management, this entails generating numerous forecasts and managing the infrastructure required for machine learning (ML) model development and deployment. However, by utilizing BigQuery ML in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can streamline this process. BigQuery ML allows you to train, evaluate, and deploy ML models directly using SQL statements, bypassing the need for a separate ML infrastructure. This approach can significantly save time and resources in your e-commerce sales forecasting project.
