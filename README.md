# GoogleCloud_InventoryManagement_ML_Forecasting

Abstract: The project introduces a comprehensive solution for enhancing inventory management in the e-commerce domain. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Google Cloud Platform, our system integrates Big Data and Machine Learning to optimize inventory levels. The core of our analytics pipeline resides in Google BigQuery, where data summarization and analysis take place, providing dynamic insights into inventory availability and accurate demand forecasting. The culmination of our efforts is a user-friendly dashboard developed on Google's Looker Studio. This platform empowers end-users and clients to intuitively visualize product inventory counts and forecasts, facilitating informed decision-making and efficient inventory control.
